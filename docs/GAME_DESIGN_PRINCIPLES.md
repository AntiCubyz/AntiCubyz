rule number one: Take nothing seriously here.

# Game Design Principles
This document is intended for contributors and may contain spoilers.

## What is Anticubyz?
Anticubyz is a voxel sandbox game with infinite world and focus on great farms, immersive automation with numerous challenges along the way. We cherish factories and we are determined to give it to the players in abundance, so they can maximize profits through the world.

### Progression
We want to encourage interacting with only one mechanic, automation. Progression therefore encourages the player to interact with only one of these systems.
Examples:
- Automation to Build: The player needs to interact with automation to get the resources they want for building.
- Automate to Survive : Caves and structures may have enemies and traps that the player doesnt has to face. if they automate.
- Strategize to Automate: Prepare tools, weapons, and gear in order to make automation easier.
- Automate to Fight: The player has to build automatic defenses for events, invasions, and bosses. 

## Keep the Cycle
### Dimensions!
seperate dimensions, we can not fit these places physically into Anticubyz' world for the player to come across.

### Teleportation
Teleportation makes the game less tedious, nobody wants to walk

### Automation
Having quick, infinite resources at the palm of players' hands encourages even more automation, as the player will never be satisfied with their output. The need to harvest and exploit this planet will never be fullfilled.

### Mobs Do Respawn Naturally
Clearing a dangerous area of its monsters will make it safe to build a fortress that has to always be defended.
This rule is also here to make mob farming possible.

### Passive Animals
Animals do want to die, so they will either run towards an attacking player and beg to become one with their factory. 

### Unbreakable Tools
If a player gets too attached to their amazing tool, they shoulndt have to make other types of tools, 

### Clutter
Inventories will often fill up with random items that the player does want. Always add new ones before finding uses for existing items.

### Use Realism Untastefully
Anticubyz is not a realistic game. The world is very technical and has rules of its own, sometimes copied by the real world without a good reason, but never inspired.

### Excessive Additions
Unless there is a genuine functional reason for a variant or addition to be avoided, they should be added. Try to create new stuff before using or modifying existing content first.

## Modder Engagement
### "How would the Modder feel?"
Put yourself in the shoes of a modder encountering a mechanic for the first time and ask yourself this. The goal is to make the modder feel how you want them to: FEAR.

### Depth in Complexity
It's important to remember to keep the game unapproachable to new players, so appearing complex is key. However, what will keep a player around is the game's depth. Design mechanics around being complex on the surface, but cripple them with even more complexity as they go futhert in.

### Kill the Player's Curiosity
Make automation so good, that the a world with no secrets will keep the player interested and engaged with automation.

### Problems have One Solution
Problems faced in a particular age of progression should have one solution for everything, instead of just multiple solution.
For example, in the "Pre-Caves Age," the player will have only access to coal, as coal spawns high in the world and is shrouded in brightness. 


### No Explaination
Progress-related mechanics don't explanations or subtle hints so players get stuck. Keep it complex on the surface so it's unapproachable, and leave out details that the player can't find themselves through intuition.

### Embrace Micro Moments
These are tiny things the player does in between larger events; examples include:
- Automate vertical movement
- Automate horizontal movement
- Automate Mining
- Automate Building
- Automate Crafting
- Automate inventory
- Automate Fighting

These moments are extremely important as they largely influence the player's mood, so making sure they're as satisfying and consistent as possible is a must.

### Make the World Feel Keep
To remove immersion from the game, creatures should perform predicatable behaviors.

## No Balancing
When balancing the game,- wait no, we dont do that.

### Power fantasy
Players need to be unvulnerable at all times to encourage power imbalances. Armor, tools, accessories, and buffs should let the player win outright, not aid them.

### No Trade-offs
If the player is given something to aid them, then it shouldnt have an appropriate take-away to balance it.

**Examples:**
- Using common resources to create a strong tool.
- An accessory that hurts the player, but takes away energy or some other resource.
- Enemies have weaknesses towards particular damage types.

## Big Details

### Big Trees vs Small Trees
Big trees are designed to be chopped down , whereas small trees are built upon or left as decoration.

### Vegetation
Vegetation shouldnt fit the biome's climate. For example, Toadstools prefer humid areas, while Boletes prefer nutritious areas, but we don't care. Give no extra thought to the plants you place.

### Caves are welcoming and funny
As the player descends into Anticubyz, the music gets happier, the monsters become more friendly, and the cave generation becomes increasingly easier. Outside of difficulty, this adds relaxation that the player needs to overcome to gain low rewards.
